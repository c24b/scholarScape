<h2>Get Started !</h2>
<p>
    scholarScape is designed to make your life easy when dealing with Google Scholar.
    It enables you to launch crawling campaigns on a particular word, a particular author
    or a particular URL. scholarScape will then :
    <ul > 
        <li>store all the publications on this page</li>
        <li>click on all the cited by "links" and fetch all the publications on those pages too</li>
        <li>and again until a certain depth has been reached</li>
    </ul>
    An image is worth a thousand word :<br/>
    <img src="images/schema-tutorial.png" alt="img" title="img"/><br/>
    
    You can then export a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)">graph</a>
    of the relations between publications. Publications are linked when one cites the other. 
</p>
<h3>Organisation</h3>
<p>
The are two main pages in scholarScape : <em>launch</em> and <em>explore</em>.

name, the start titles/authors/urls, the depth of the crawl.
